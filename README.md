# 🚚 NC Elite Router: Meals on Wheels Edition

A mobile-optimized logistics tool designed to help volunteers navigate delivery routes efficiently.

## 🌟 The Problem
Volunteer drivers often struggle with fragmented address lists, manual data entry into GPS, and tracking progress across multiple stops. Driving and searching for addresses simultaneously is both inefficient and stressful.

## 🚀 The Solution
This app acts as a **Logistics Command Center** that bridges the gap between raw data and real-world navigation.
- **Flexible Input:** Add stops via Excel upload, Google-style search, or manual entry.
- **Smart GPS Integration:** One-touch navigation that sends remaining stops directly to Google Maps.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time metrics showing completed vs. remaining deliveries.
- **Mobile-First Design:** High-contrast, thumb-friendly UI for on-the-road use.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. **Setup:** Set your Start and End points in the sidebar.
2. **Load:** Upload an Excel file or search for specific delivery addresses.
3. **Navigate:** Click "Launch GPS Navigation" to open your route in Google Maps.
4. **Track:** Check off addresses as you complete them; the app will update your remaining route automatically.
