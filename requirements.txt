# Meals on Wheels: NC Elite Router

## The Problem
Volunteer drivers often struggle to organize multiple delivery stops efficiently. Manually entering addresses into GPS is time-consuming and doesn't provide a clear checklist of completed deliveries.

## The Solution
This application allows drivers to:
- **Upload Excel** delivery lists instantly.
- **Search & Add** addresses via the ArcGIS Map server.
- **Manual Entry** for quick updates.
- **Optimize** the route to save time and gas.
- **Launch GPS** navigation for the entire route in one click.
